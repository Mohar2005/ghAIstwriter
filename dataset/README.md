## ghAIstwriter Dataset

We provide a dataset of 164 pairs of Python functions and corresponding strategies for property-based testing of those functions with [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/). The dataset is available in this directory as in both JSONL (`ghaistwriter.jsonl`) and CSV (`ghaistwriter.csv`) formats.

The `generate/` directory details how the dataset was generated.
